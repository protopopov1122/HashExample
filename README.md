## Hash function examples

This repo contains custom hash function implementation and comparison with 64-bit FNV-0. The function is not cryptographic 
but rather a string checksum-related. Repo also contains two simple hash table implementations for testing purposes.
Data samples are located in the `examples` directory. The hash function is not a result of any dicrete math studies but a
result of messing and random juggling with XOR, sums, multiplies and primes. For my samples it works decently, however it
is a result of empirical-based coefficient selection.
